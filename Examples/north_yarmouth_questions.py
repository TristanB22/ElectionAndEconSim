    # Question 1 - Maine Voter ID & Absentee Ballot Restrictions
    """Question 1 — Maine Voter ID & Absentee Ballot Restrictions

Over the past year, a citizen-initiated proposal called Question 1 has dominated Maine political discussion.

It would require every voter to present a government-issued photo ID when voting in person and would also impose new rules on absentee ballots: limiting who can request or return them, reducing the number of drop boxes to one per town, and ending "ongoing absentee" status for permanently disabled or senior voters.

Supporters argue that these steps are necessary to protect election integrity and rebuild public trust. They say Maine should join most other states in verifying identity at the polls and tightening absentee procedures to prevent potential abuse.

Opponents argue that Maine already has no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and that the measure would make voting harder for people in rural areas, seniors, and those without easy access to ID offices. The governor, civic groups, and many town clerks have publicly opposed it, saying it fixes a problem that doesn't exist.

The measure has been covered widely in local media, discussed in town meetings, and challenged in court before being approved for this ballot.

How do you vote on Question 1?

YES – Require photo ID for in-person voting and tighten absentee ballot rules.

NO – Keep the current election laws without new ID or absentee restrictions.

    # Question 2 - Temporary Weapons Restriction Orders ("Red Flag" Law)
    """Question 2 — Temporary Weapons Restriction Orders ("Red Flag" Law)

Question 2 asks whether Maine should adopt a temporary weapons-restriction law, sometimes called a "red-flag" law.

It would allow a judge—after a petition by police or a family member—to temporarily remove firearms from someone shown to pose a serious danger to themselves or others. The idea grew out of the debate after the 2023 Lewiston mass shooting, where the existing "yellow-flag" law was criticized as too slow and bureaucratic.

Supporters say the new system would save lives by giving families and law enforcement a faster way to act before a tragedy occurs, with judicial oversight and time limits built in.

Opponents—particularly gun-rights advocates—warn that it could erode due-process protections and allow firearms to be seized based on subjective claims or political bias. They argue the focus should be on enforcing existing laws and improving mental-health services rather than expanding state power.

Campaigns on both sides have aired ads, organized rallies, and highlighted the balance between public safety and individual rights.

How do you vote on Question 2?

YES – Allow courts to issue temporary orders removing firearms from individuals deemed dangerous.

NO – Reject the proposal and keep Maine's current "yellow-flag" framework.

    # Question 3 - Yarmouth Water District Charter Replacement
    """Question 3 — Yarmouth Water District Charter Replacement

Voters in Yarmouth and North Yarmouth share the Yarmouth Water District (YWD), which provides drinking-water services. Its governing charter dates back to 1923, with more than a dozen separate amendments passed over the decades.

The district and local officials have proposed repealing and replacing that old charter with a new, consolidated document that:

– Updates legal language to match modern state statutes.

– Codifies the existing practice of electing trustees by secret ballot instead of at open meetings.

– Clarifies financial and reporting procedures but leaves rates, ownership, and service areas unchanged.

Proponents—including current trustees—say it simply modernizes outdated language and improves transparency and accountability.

Skeptics question whether any change could subtly shift control or open the door to rate or governance changes in the future. Public hearings in September and October 2025 outlined the differences, and the district posted a detailed side-by-side comparison of the old and new charters.

How do you vote on the Yarmouth Water District charter question?

YES – Approve the new, consolidated charter to replace the 1923 version.

NO – Keep operating under the original 1923 charter and its amendments.
