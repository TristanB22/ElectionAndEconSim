# World_Sim Overview

In a world where more information about every piece of reality is being collected every day, events that have the greatest impacts on our lives are still unexpected. Why? The course of history seems obvious looking backwards: of course Russia's authoritarian decline under an ex-Soviet spy would yield an invasion of Ukraine or that leverage in the housing market would spark the 2008 recession -- a crisis few predicted, yet one that ABMs warn of. However, looking forward, nobody has any idea what the future will look like, leaving the world vulnerable to sudden shocks with high economic and social costs. 

This thesis develops the first ABM framework that integrates LLM-driven reasoning to balance realism, scalability, and explainability in simulation. This entails building an ABM framework to create ground-up simulations of the world to supplant the current faulty top-down models. The driving theory behind this project is that language models can serve as a salient and accurate proxy for people's decision making, and thus we leverage that to generate probability distributions over the future. 

Portions of this project have been edited by artificial intelligence. In general, AI was used to clean up code and add comments where logic was unclear.
